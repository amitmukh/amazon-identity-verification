## Identity Verification using AWS services

MIND: This demo is not production ready. Is just an example showing identity verification workflow leveraging Amazon Rekognition

This demo shows how to leverage on Amazon Rekognition in order to aquire an identification document (ID document, Passport, Driving License), reading avalues from the document 
and verify the face in the document with the owner at a browser webcam.

This demo can be a starting point in discussion and implementation of an ideintity verification workflow.

Here an architectural overview of the demo.
